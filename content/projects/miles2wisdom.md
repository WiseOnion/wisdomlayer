## Challenge

Miles2Wisdom, a family and marriage therapy practice, was operating with scattered, manual processes. Clients had to call or message to schedule appointments, intake and applicant tracking were handled through email chains, and the practice lacked a cohesive professional web presence. This made onboarding difficult and first impressions inconsistent—critical issues for a mental health practice where trust is everything.

## Solution

I built a custom website from the ground up using clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a lightweight, fully responsive experience. The site features:

- **Integrated booking system** allowing clients to self-schedule therapy sessions
- **Client intake and application forms** that streamline the onboarding process
- **Meet the Team page** showcasing therapist credentials, bios, and availability to build immediate trust
- **Calm, professional design** that reflects the therapeutic nature of the practice
- **Mobile-first responsive design** ensuring accessibility across all devices

The architecture is scalable and flexible, allowing the practice to grow without technical limitations.

## Results

- **Self-service scheduling** eliminated phone tag and made booking instant and convenient
- **Centralized intake process** replaced scattered email threads with organized submissions
- **Positive client feedback** highlighting the site's trustworthy, simple user experience
- **Strong professional presence** that positions Miles2Wisdom as a modern, accessible practice
- **Portfolio showcase** demonstrating capability to build functional healthcare sites with booking systems

## Testimonial

"The website represents our practice perfectly. It's calm, professional, and easy to use. Scheduling and intake are way smoother now, and our clients love how simple everything is."
